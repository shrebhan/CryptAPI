CryptAPI - KMIP Library for desktop & Andriod developers

As a part of my final year project, my team and I developed a library implementing OASIS' KMIP - Key Management Interoperability Protocol.
(https://docs.oasis-open.org/kmip/kmip-spec/v2.0/os/kmip-spec-v2.0-os.html)
We used IBM's Security Key Life-cylce Manager as our management server to store the encryption keys. 
The significance of storing keys on a remote server was to avoid attacks on the system by gaining physical access to keys store within the device, for example, to prevent a Trash Can Attack.

Used these keys in existing encryption algorithms and provided desktop and mobile developers with a high level API calls to use these encryption algorithms.
