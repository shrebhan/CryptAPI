#CryptAPI

As a part of my final year project we developed a library implementing the specification of OASIS' KMIP - Key Management Interoperability Protocol using IBM's Security Key Life-cylce Manager to store the encryption keys. 

Used these keys in existing encryption algorithms and provided desktop and mobile developers with a high level API calls to use these encryption algorithms.
